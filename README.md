# Learning C

Many thanks to the authors of the C tutorial at [CProgramming.com](https://cprogramming.com) for putting together lovely resources for free without requiring an account (and the giving up of personal data).

This repository simply contains files with comment notes and code from the above resource. Making public in case it's useful to anyone, but primarily this is just a resource for me to practice & learn.
